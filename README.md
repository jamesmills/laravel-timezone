An easy way to set a timezone for a user in your application and then show date/times to them in their local timezone. 

## How does it work 

This package listens for the `\Illuminate\Auth\Events\Login` event and will then automatically set a `timezone` on your `user` model (stored in the database).

This package uses the [torann/geoip](http://lyften.com/projects/laravel-geoip/doc/) package which looks up the users location based on their IP address. The package also returns information like the users currency and users timezone. [You can configure this package separately if you require](#custom-configuration).

 ## How to use

You can show dates to your user in their timezone by using

```php
{{ Timezone::convertToLocal($post->created_at) }}
```

Or use our nice blade directive

```php
@displayDate($post->created_at)
```

[More examples below](#examples)

## Installation

Pull in the package using Composer

```
composer require jamesmills/laravel-timezone
```

Publish database migrations
 
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JamesMills\LaravelTimezone\LaravelTimezoneServiceProvider" --tag=migrations
```

Run the database migrations. This will add a `timezone` column to your `users` table.

```
php artisan migrate
```

## Flash Messages

By default when the timezone has been set there is a flash message set in the session. There is an optional integration to use [laracasts/flash](https://github.com/laracasts/flash) package if you wish. Just publish the config options (info below) and override the default settings.  


## Custom Configuration

Publishing the config file is optional.

There isn't much to configure right now. You only need to do this if you want to use Laracast Flash Messages

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="JamesMills\LaravelTimezone\LaravelTimezoneServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

If you wish to customise the underlying `torann/geoip` package you can publish the config file by using the command below.

```php
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Torann\GeoIP\GeoIPServiceProvider" --tag=config
```

## Examples

### Showing date/time to the user in their timezone

Default will use the format `jS F Y g:i:a` and will not show the timezone

```php
{{ Timezone::convertToLocal($post->created_at) }}

// 4th July 2018 3:32:am
```

If you wish you can set a custom format and also include a nice version of the timezone

```php
{{ Timezone::convertToLocal($post->created_at, 'Y-m-d g:i', true) }}

// 2018-07-04 3:32 New York, America
```

### Using blade directive

Making your life easier one small step at a time

```php
@displayDate($post->created_at)

// 4th July 2018 3:32:am
```

And with custom formatting

```php
@displayDate($post->created_at, 'Y-m-d g:i', true)

// 2018-07-04 3:32 New York, America
```


### Saving the users input to the database in UTC

This will take a date/time, set it to the users timezone then return it as UTC in a Carbon instance.

```php
$post = Post::create([
    'publish_at' => Timezone::convertFromLocal($request->get('publish_at')),
    'description' => $request->input('description'),
]);
```

## Treeware

You're free to use this package, but if it makes it to your production environment I would highly appreciate you buying the world a tree.

It’s now common knowledge that one of the best tools to tackle the climate crisis and keep our temperatures from rising above 1.5C is to <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-48870920">plant trees</a>. If you contribute to my forest you’ll be creating employment for local families and restoring wildlife habitats.

## Issues

If you receive a message like `This cache store does not support tagging` this is because the `torann/geoip` package requires a caching driver which supports tagging and you probably have your application set to use the `file` cache driver. You can [publish the config file](#custom-configuration) for the `torann/geoip` package and set `'cache_tags' => null,` to solve this.
